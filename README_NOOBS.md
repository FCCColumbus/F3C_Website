This readme will attempt to give newbies the tools/steps necessary to work on the FCCC website

Working on the website [requires a github account](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/)

Basic understanding of Git is necessary to work on the website


Stages to work on website:

Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.
Clone
Branch
Make a change
Commit that change
"Push" changes to your origin
"Pull Request" origin/branch-name against upstream/dev
